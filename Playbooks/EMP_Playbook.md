# EMP Response Playbook
**Version:** 0.1.0 | **Date:** 2026-01-27

## Objectives
1) Protect life, 2) Preserve critical assets, 3) Rapidly restore priority functions, 4) Maintain positive control.

## Phasing
### Phase 0 – Preparation (Pre-Event)
- Faraday cage inventory (radios, spares, laptops, SDRs)
- Generator and micro-hydro blackstart test monthly
- Offline backups; print critical phone trees and maps

### Phase 1 – 0 to 1 Hour (Immediate)
- Declare **ALPHA-LOCK**
- Personnel muster; accountability within 15 min
- Power: Isolate sensitive loads; check breakers/surge
- Comms: Primary radio net check; deploy handhelds from Faraday
- Intel: Confirm scope (grid, regional, national)

### Phase 2 – 1 to 24 Hours (Stabilize)
- Blackstart sequence:
  1. Inspect generators / fuel
  2. Bring up **Resonance Energy Systems** micro-hydro (if flow available)
  3. Prioritize loads: Comms → Pumps → Refrigeration → Medical
- Water: Assess head/flow; ram pump check
- Logistics: Fuel run plan; establish perimeter patrols

### Phase 3 – 1 to 7 Days (Sustain)
- Rotate crews; enforce sleep cycles
- Repair/replace surge-damaged endpoints
- Ration non-critical loads; maintain SitRep cycle

## Checklists
- **EMP Kit:** Radios x6, spare batteries, solar roll, wire, ferrites, EMP bags
- **Docs:** Printed contacts, maps, procedures, key index cards
- **Comms Nets:** Primary/Alt/HF; authentication words; time sync at H+6

## Decision Triggers
- **Trigger A:** No grid > 4h → Start microgrid
- **Trigger B:** Comms compromised → Switch to brevity + runners
- **Trigger C:** Fuel < 50% → Initiate resupply run with escort

## Roles
- **CDR:** Declares posture, assigns priorities
- **XO:** Timekeeping, deconfliction
- **S3:** Executes blackstart steps, tracks status
- **S2:** Threat watch; access control
- **S4:** Fuel/water/spares; ration plan
- **S6:** Nets, radios, antenna checks, EMP discipline
