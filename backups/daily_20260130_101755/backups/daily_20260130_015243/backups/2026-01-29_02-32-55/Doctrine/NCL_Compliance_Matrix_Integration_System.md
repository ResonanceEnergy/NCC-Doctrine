## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **NCL Insights Engine** - Generates and distributes 500+ insights across departments
2. **Compliance Matrix** - Real-time tracking of directive compliance across 24 departments
3. **Feedback Loop Processor** - Analyzes compliance improvements vs. NCL effectiveness
4. **Optimization Algorithm** - Automatically adjusts NCL priorities based on compliance data
5. **Predictive Analytics** - Forecasts compliance trends and identifies risks

### Integration Flow
```
NCL Insights Distribution → Department Implementation → Compliance Matrix Update →
Performance Analytics → NCL Optimization → Enhanced Insights → Repeat
```
