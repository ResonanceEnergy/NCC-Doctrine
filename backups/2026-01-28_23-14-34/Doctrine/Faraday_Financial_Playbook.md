# Faraday Financial Corporation (FFC) Playbook: Our Financial Bible

## Executive Summary
This document serves as FFC's ultimate financial playbook - our game-day super secret formula to ultimate success. It outlines a comprehensive framework for 50 quantitative trading strategies, analyzed and ranked by ROI potential, startup ease, initial capital requirements, risk profile, and proven track record. The framework provides a systematic approach to building FFC's financial supremacy through disciplined execution and risk management.

## Framework Overview

### 8-Pillar Research & Execution Architecture

#### P1. Research Canon & Evidence Tags
Every strategy is grounded in peer-reviewed academic literature and practitioner studies. We maintain a living bibliography with the most credible sources, tracking edge persistence across market regimes.

#### P2. Scoring Model
Five-axis scoring system (1-5 scale, higher better):
- **ROI**: Edge potential & capacity from academic literature
- **Ease**: Startup complexity (data, modeling, infrastructure)
- **Capital**: Initial capital requirements (margin, borrow, relationships)
- **Risk**: Left-tail exposure, crowding, regime sensitivity
- **Track Record**: Evidence strength, recency, robustness

#### P3. Execution Architecture
- Market data stack (daily + intraday bars, event calendars, options chains)
- Backtesting harness with event filters and slippage modeling
- Broker/risk rules with kill-switches and position limits

#### P4. Risk & Compliance
Strategy-level hard limits, stress tests, and compliance approvals for derivatives and primary market participation.

#### P5. Capital Allocation
Waterfall allocation by priority score with pilot→live gates and automatic de-risk rules.

#### P6. Monitoring
Daily edge health tracking, regime switches, and slippage mapping.

#### P7. Playbooks
Detailed runbooks for each strategy with entry/exit criteria, hedges, and disable rules.

#### P8. Change Management
All changes logged and A/B tested before promotion.

## Strategy Scoring Matrix

### Scoring Weights
Priority Score = (ROI × 0.30) + (Ease × 0.20) + ((6-Capital) × 0.15) + ((6-Risk) × 0.20) + (Track Record × 0.15)

## 20-Point Risk Analysis Framework

Each strategy is evaluated across 20 risk dimensions:

1. **Market Regime Sensitivity** - Dependence on macro conditions
2. **Tail/Gap Risk** - Exposure to extreme moves
3. **Underlying Liquidity** - Capacity and slippage constraints
4. **Derivatives Liquidity** - Options/futures market depth
5. **Slippage/Market Impact** - Trading cost variability
6. **Crowding/Alpha Decay** - Institutional participation effects
7. **Structural/Edge Decay** - Long-term persistence
8. **Event Risk** - Macro/earnings event exposure
9. **Model Risk** - Overfitting and signal construction
10. **Data/Feed Integrity** - Input quality and reliability
11. **Execution/Operational Risk** - Trading system failures
12. **Counterparty/Prime Risk** - Broker and funding risks
13. **Funding/Financing** - Carry and margin costs
14. **Borrow/Securities Lending** - Short availability
15. **Legal/Compliance** - Regulatory and venue rules
16. **Technology/Controls** - System reliability
17. **Capacity/Scalability** - Size limitations
18. **Correlation Spike Exposure** - Beta clustering
19. **Vol-of-Vol Exposure** - Volatility regime changes
20. **Governance/Process Maturity** - Operational controls
