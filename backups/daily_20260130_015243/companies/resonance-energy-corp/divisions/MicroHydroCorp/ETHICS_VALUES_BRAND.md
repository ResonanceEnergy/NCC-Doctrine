## Core Values

### 1. Human Ingenuity & Spirit
**Description:** We celebrate humanity's timeless ability to understand nature, innovate, and build lasting solutions. Our work honors the spirit of the millers, engineers, and craftspeople who created waterwheels and windmills that powered civilizations.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Design is visible and understandable; celebrate the mechanics and elegance, not hide complexity
- Every product embodies the philosophy that humans can do remarkable things with nature's resources
- Chase efficiency, reliability, and beauty with equal passion

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Hire people who care about craftsmanship and continuous improvement
- Invest in training and expertise; respect specialized knowledge
- Share our engineering knowledge generously; contribute to the broader renewable energy community
- Celebrate team contributions and individual ingenuity

---

### 2. Durability & Longevity
**Description:** We build for generations, not years. Our systems are designed for 30+ year service life, with serviceability, spare parts, and continuous improvement baked in from day one. We learn from mills that operated for 100+ years.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Material selection prioritizes long-term durability and corrosion resistance, not initial cost
- Design for periodic maintenance and component replacement; make servicing economical and DIY-friendly
- Use standardized, sourceable components; avoid proprietary lock-in
- Test for durability; validate 30-year performance through simulation and accelerated testing

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Warranty and support reflect our confidence; we back our products
- Create comprehensive spare parts availability and maintenance manuals
- Build relationships with customers over years and decades, not one-time transactions
- Track long-term customer outcomes; learn from field failures and successes

---

### 3. Simplicity & Elegance
**Description:** We solve complex problems with elegant, simple solutions. Unnecessary complexity is waste. Our systems should be understandable to an intelligent customer and maintainable by skilled local technicians.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Minimize moving parts; each component must earn its place
- Favor mechanical solutions over electronic controls (where feasible); mechanical systems age gracefully
- Design for failure gracefully; if something breaks, the system degrades gradually, not catastrophically
- Aesthetics matter; beautiful engineering is more likely to be respected and maintained

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Say "no" to features that complicate without adding value
- Challenge every component and assembly step: "Is this necessary?"
- Prioritize clarity in documentation and communication
- Simplify operations; complex processes invite errors

---

### 4. Connection to Nature & Place
**Description:** We work *with* natural forces (water, gravity, seasons), not against them. Our systems celebrate water as life-giving and sacred, not merely a resource to extract. We are place-based; our designs adapt to local geography and conditions.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Design for site-specific conditions (head, flow, seasonal variability); avoid forcing one-size-fits-all solutions
- Minimize environmental footprint; design for minimal ecosystem disruption
- Plan for end-of-life; materials should be recyclable or safely biodegradable
- Celebrate water visually and audibly; the mechanism should remind users of the precious resource being harnessed

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Source materials responsibly; know where components come from
- Measure and minimize our manufacturing footprint
- Support water conservation and watershed health in communities we serve
- Educate customers about the water cycle and their role in stewarding it

---

### 5. Local Resilience & Community
**Description:** We believe energy is best generated locally, at community scale, creating economic and social resilience. We support local manufacturing, employment, and expertise. We are partners to communities, not distant suppliers.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Design for local manufacturability and assembly where possible; support regional economies
- Create training and certification programs for local installers and technicians
- Build community feedback loops; products evolve with local needs
- Document and share knowledge; avoid locking customers into proprietary service

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Prioritize hiring and partnerships within communities we serve
- Support apprenticeship and mentorship programs
- Contribute a portion of profits back to watershed and community resilience initiatives
- Measure success by community impact, not just financial metrics

---

### 6. Excellence & Continuous Improvement
**Description:** We pursue mastery. Every product, every process, every interaction should reflect our commitment to excellence. We learn from failures, celebrate successes, and never become complacent.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Set performance targets higher than industry standards; aim to be the best
- Test rigorously; failures in testing prevent failures in the field
- Iterate and improve; v2 should be noticeably better than v1
- Capture and share lessons learned; every project informs the next

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Hire people who care about quality and take pride in their work
- Invest in continuous training and skill development
- Celebrate improvement ideas from all levels; reward innovation
- Measure and track quality metrics; make data visible to all teams

---

### 7. Economic Wisdom & Long-Term Value
**Description:** We design for ROI. Our systems should pay for themselves, create ongoing value, and make environmental responsibility economically smart. Short-term profit is less important than long-term customer success and market trust.

**Implications for design and product:**
- Performance targets should include lifecycle economics; total cost of ownership is the real measure
- Design for minimal operating and maintenance costs; efficiency matters
- Create transparent pricing and warranty; build trust through honesty
- Plan for component replacement costs; make spare parts affordable

**Implications for operations and culture:**
- Price fairly; margin should reflect value created, not exploitation
- Track customer ROI carefully; if customers struggle, we improve
- Invest in quality and durability, even if it increases initial cost
- Make decisions with long-term consequences in mind; avoid short-term thinking
