## 6. 100 Industry Insights: Startup Scripts & Run Modes

1. Init scripts are traditional shell scripts used in Unix-like systems to start, stop, and manage system services during boot and shutdown processes.

2. Systemd is a modern init system and service manager for Linux that replaces traditional init scripts with unit files for better dependency management and parallel service startup.

3. Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run at specified times or intervals using the cron daemon, commonly used for periodic system maintenance and automated backups.

4. Windows Task Scheduler allows scheduling tasks on Windows systems, supporting triggers like time-based schedules, event-based activations, or system startup events.

5. Upstart was an event-based init system used in older Ubuntu versions, focusing on starting services based on events rather than traditional runlevels.

6. Launchd is Apple's init system for macOS, handling daemon processes and scheduled tasks with property list (plist) configuration files.

7. rc scripts are run control scripts in BSD systems, executed during system boot to initialize services and set up the system environment.

8. Anacron extends cron by running jobs that were missed due to system downtime, ensuring periodic tasks are executed even after power failures.

9. The 'at' command schedules one-time tasks to run at a specific time, complementing cron for non-repeating jobs like system maintenance windows.

10. Supervisor is a process control system that can start, stop, and monitor processes, often used for application-level startup scripts in development environments.

11. Continuous run mode keeps a process running indefinitely, suitable for daemons and long-running services like web servers or monitoring agents.

12. Batch mode executes tasks in sequence without user interaction, ideal for data processing jobs that handle large datasets overnight.
