**NCC Universal Security Mandate**

**Directive Level:** CRITICAL - ALL PERSONNEL  
**Classification:** NCC TOP SECRET  
**Effective Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Last Updated:** Real-time via NCC Security Council

## Executive Summary

The Security 10 Directive establishes absolute zero-tolerance protocols for all forms of cross-contamination, information leaks, and operational spills across all NCC departments and subsidiaries. This directive supersedes all other security protocols and requires immediate implementation in every department, division, and operational unit.

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero-Tolerance Enforcement
- **No Exceptions:** All leaks, spills, and cross-contamination incidents are treated as critical security breaches
- **Immediate Response:** Detection triggers automatic containment and investigation protocols
- **Accountability:** Personal responsibility at all levels of command

### 2. Universal Application
- **All Departments:** Every NCC subsidiary, division, and operational unit
- **All Personnel:** From entry-level to executive leadership
- **All Information:** Digital, physical, and cognitive domains

### 3. Proactive Prevention
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time surveillance of all containment boundaries
- **Predictive Analysis:** AI-driven threat detection and prevention
- **Regular Audits:** Mandatory security assessments and penetration testing

## Containment Categories

### Category A: Information Cross-Contamination
**Definition:** Unauthorized transfer of classified information between compartments  
**Examples:** NNO protocol violations, data sharing without clearance, compartment boundary breaches  
**Response Level:** IMMEDIATE - Automatic system lockdown and investigation

### Category B: Operational Spills
**Definition:** Uncontrolled release of sensitive operational data or capabilities  
**Examples:** Accidental disclosure of proprietary technology, security protocol failures, system breaches  
**Response Level:** CRITICAL - Full operational quarantine and executive notification

### Category C: Physical Contamination
**Definition:** Unauthorized access to physical secure areas or materials  
**Examples:** Facility intrusions, equipment tampering, supply chain compromises  
**Response Level:** EMERGENCY - Site lockdown and external security deployment

### Category D: Digital Leaks
**Definition:** Unauthorized exfiltration of digital assets or communications  
**Examples:** Network breaches, malware infections, insider threats, quantum attacks  
**Response Level:** URGENT - Network segmentation and forensic analysis

### Category E: Human Factors
**Definition:** Personnel-related security compromises  
**Examples:** Social engineering, insider threats, negligence, coercion  
**Response Level:** PRIORITY - Psychological evaluation and access revocation
