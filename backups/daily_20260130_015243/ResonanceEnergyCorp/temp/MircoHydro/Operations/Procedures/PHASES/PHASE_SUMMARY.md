## Decision Process

Each tier follows the same pattern:

1. **Create Archive**
   - Identify duplicates via SHA256 hash
   - Move to archive folder (not delete)
   - Verify counts match

2. **Monitor**
   - 7-30 days depending on tier
   - Daily 5-minute check
   - Watch for red flags

3. **Decide**
   - Review monitoring results
   - Team sign-off
   - Document decision

4. **Delete** (if approved)
   - Permanent removal
   - Verify archive empty
   - Free storage confirmed
