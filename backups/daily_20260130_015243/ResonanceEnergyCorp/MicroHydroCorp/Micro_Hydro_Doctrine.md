# Micro Hydro Corp Doctrine

Micro Hydro Corp harnesses the power of small-scale hydroelectric systems to generate sustainable, decentralized energy solutions. Aligned with Resonance Energy Systems principles: small, self-propagating systems that generate compounding value through renewable energy.

## Mission
To democratize energy production through micro-hydro technology, enabling communities and individuals to achieve energy independence and financial resilience.

## Core Principles
- **Small Scale, Big Impact:** Focus on systems under 100kW that can power homes, farms, and small businesses.
- **Self-Sustaining:** Systems that generate excess energy for sale back to the grid or local markets.
- **Compounding Value:** Energy production creates both utility and revenue streams that compound over time.
- **Decentralized:** Distributed generation reduces reliance on centralized power grids.

## Technology Focus
- Ram pump turbines
- Micro-turbines
- Pico-hydro systems
- Stream and river adaptations

## Integration with NCC Doctrine
Micro Hydro Corp operates under the Resonance Energy umbrella, contributing to the broader NCC ecosystem through sustainable energy solutions that support wealth-building and operational resilience.

## Implementation Protocol
Consult C-Suite CIO and CTO for technology integration and approval.
