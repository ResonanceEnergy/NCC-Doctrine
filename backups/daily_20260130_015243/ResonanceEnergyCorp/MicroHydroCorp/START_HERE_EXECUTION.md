## 📞 QUICK HELP

**Question: Where's the old SoT location?**  
Answer: Archived at `c:\MircoHydro\MICRO HYDRO NEW\MicroHydroV1 — SoT_ARCHIVED_20260124\`

**Question: Do team members need to change anything?**  
Answer: No. New location works exactly the same. Scripts use relative paths.

**Question: What if we find issues during Phase 1?**  
Answer: Escalate and investigate. Can postpone Phase 2-4 until resolved.

**Question: Can we speed up Phase 2?**  
Answer: No. 7-day monitoring is required to ensure stability.

**Question: What happens to the old backup files?**  
Answer: Kept for 90 days minimum per retention policy.

**Question: Do we need team approval for each phase?**  
Answer: Phase 1 yes. Phases 2-4 are technical execution (pre-approved).
