## Why Tier 3 Needs Community Review

Unlike Tiers 1 & 2:
- These files have **long history**
- Team may have **emotional attachment** (old work)
- May contain **institutional knowledge**
- Community should **decide what to keep**

**Better approach:**
- Let team review (Feb 22-28)
- Get consensus on what's safe to delete
- Document reasoning
- Archive remaining (Mar 1)
- Final sign-off (Mar 31)
- Delete only what's approved (Apr 1)

**Decision:**
→ **YES:** Delete Apr 1 (50-100 MB freed)

## Community Review Process (Feb 22-28)

1. **List shared with team**
   - What's being considered for deletion
   - Why (it's a duplicate)
   - When (after Mar 1 approval)

2. **Team reviews**
   - "Keep this, delete that"
   - Explain reasoning
   - Highlight institutional knowledge

3. **Consolidate feedback**
   - Identify consensus items
   - Flag controversial items
   - Create final deletion list

4. **Document decisions**
   - Why each item approved/rejected
   - Who approved it
   - Reference for future

## Red Flags (Same as Other Tiers)

❌ Archive file count changes  
❌ Archive file size decreases  
❌ System performance issues  
❌ Backup becomes unavailable  
❌ Team discovers unexpected content  

**If ANY occur:** Escalate and reassess.
