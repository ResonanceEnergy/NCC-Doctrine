# Security 10 Directive - NCC Enterprise Security Framework

## Overview
The Security 10 Directive establishes comprehensive security protocols and compliance requirements for all NCC agents, systems, and operations. This directive ensures enterprise-wide security posture, threat protection, and regulatory compliance.

## Directive Components

### 1. Security Framework Deployment
- **Automated Security Updates**: All agents must implement automated security scanning and monitoring
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Security 10 Directive compliance is mandatory for all systems
- **Centralized Security Management**: Unified security orchestration across all NCC divisions

### 2. Access Control System
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All agents implement granular permission systems
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all privileged operations
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeouts and secure token handling
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify principle applied enterprise-wide

### 3. Encryption Framework
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Mandatory for all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate lifecycle management
- **Key Rotation**: Regular encryption key rotation policies (90-day intervals)
- **Secure Communication Channels**: TLS 1.3+ for all inter-agent communications

### 4. Threat Detection System
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: Real-time network and endpoint monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered behavioral analysis
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Global threat feed integration
- **Automated Incident Response**: Orchestrated response workflows

### 5. Security Monitoring Dashboard
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live security event visualization
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated audit and compliance reports
- **Security Health Scoring**: Quantitative security posture assessment
- **Alert Management**: Centralized security alerting and escalation

## Compliance Requirements

### Agent Security Standards
- All agents must register with the Security Command Center
- Implement Security 10 compliant authentication mechanisms
- Maintain encrypted communication channels
- Report security events within 30 seconds of detection
- Participate in automated security assessments

### System Security Requirements
- Operating systems must be hardened per NCC security baselines
- Network segmentation implemented at all levels
- Regular vulnerability scanning (daily minimum)
- Automated patch management for critical vulnerabilities
- Backup encryption and integrity verification

### Data Protection Standards
- All sensitive data classified and labeled
- Encryption at rest using AES-256 minimum
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies enforced
- Retention policies with automated secure deletion
- Cross-border data transfer compliance

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Core security framework deployment
- **Phase 2 (Week 1)**: Access control and authentication systems
- **Phase 3 (Week 2)**: Encryption framework implementation
- **Phase 4 (Week 3)**: Threat detection and response systems
- **Phase 5 (Week 4)**: Security monitoring dashboard and reporting

## Security Command Center
The Cybersecurity Command Center serves as the central authority for:
- Security policy enforcement
- Threat intelligence coordination
- Incident response orchestration
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Security training and awareness

## Emergency Protocols
- **Security Breach**: Immediate isolation and containment procedures
- **Data Breach**: 1-hour notification requirement to Security Command Center
- **System Compromise**: Automated system quarantine and forensic analysis
- **Zero-Day Threats**: Emergency patch deployment within 24 hours

## Audit and Compliance
- Daily security posture assessments
- Weekly compliance audits
- Monthly penetration testing
- Quarterly security architecture reviews
- Annual third-party security assessments
