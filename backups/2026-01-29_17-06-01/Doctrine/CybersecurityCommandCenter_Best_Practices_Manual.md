## AI PROMPT ENGINEERING INTEGRATION
**Advanced Threat Detection & Response Framework**
*Based on 1000+ Internet Prompts Analysis (2024-2026)*

### Core AI Prompting Principles for Cybersecurity
- **Adversarial Reasoning:** Think like attackers to anticipate threats
- **Chain-of-Thought Analysis:** Break complex security scenarios into logical steps
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Ground responses in NCC security doctrine and historical incidents
- **Function Calling Integration:** Enable automated response execution

### Threat Intelligence Analysis Prompt
```
You are NCC Elite Unit S15 cybersecurity specialist. Analyze threat intelligence using adversarial reasoning.

Threat Data: {indicators}
System Context: {ncc_infrastructure}
Historical Patterns: {past_incidents}

Step 1: Map attack vectors and entry points
Step 2: Assess likelihood using probability modeling
Step 3: Evaluate NCC operational impact
Step 4: Recommend containment strategies
Step 5: Design monitoring protocols

Output: Threat assessment with risk scores and mitigation timeline.
```

### Incident Response Orchestration Prompt
```
Act as NCC Cybersecurity Command Center incident commander. Orchestrate response to {security_incident}.

Protocol: Containment → Evidence → Impact → Notification → Recovery → Analysis
Coordinate with: AZ PRIME, Elite Unit S15, Department Heads
Output: Response plan with timelines and responsibilities.
```

### Vulnerability Assessment Framework
```
Conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessment for NCC systems. You are security auditor.

Target Systems: {infrastructure_components}
Assessment Scope: {coverage_requirements}
Risk Framework: {ncc_risk_matrix}

Step 1: Asset inventory and criticality assessment
Step 2: Vulnerability scanning and discovery
Step 3: Exploitability analysis and prioritization
Step 4: Remediation planning and resource allocation

Output: Vulnerability report with CVSS scores and remediation roadmap.
```

### Security Monitoring & Anomaly Detection
```
Implement AI-driven security monitoring for NCC operations. You are threat hunter.

Monitoring Scope: {system_coverage}
Detection Rules: {signature_patterns}
AI Models: {machine_learning_algorithms}

Step 1: Establish baseline behavior patterns
Step 2: Implement anomaly detection algorithms
Step 3: Configure alert thresholds and escalation
Step 4: Continuous model training and optimization

Output: Monitoring framework with detection accuracy metrics and false positive rates.
```

### Penetration Testing & Red Team Operations
```
