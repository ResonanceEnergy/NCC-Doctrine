# NCC Financial Growth Doctrine

## Company Directive

Each company within the NCC enterprise will receive $5000 Canadian funds for startup costs. The team company will be responsible for building the company based on this budget allocation. The process begins with an initial $1000 in available assets capital (AAC), which must be grown to $6000 through comprehensive company-wide efforts. Upon reaching this milestone, the original $5000 startup capital will be invested into the most profitable NCC offers company at the time of funding.

The entire company operation rides on that initial $1000 AAC, requiring an immediate and sustained company-wide effort to grow funds as quickly and smoothly as possible. Every company must examine its internal infrastructure and develop 10 precise, comprehensive ways to grow funds from the initial $5000 investment. This financial growth plan represents the lifeblood of the company and must be treated with the utmost priority and strategic execution.
