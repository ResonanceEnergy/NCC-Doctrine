# NCC Doctrine Handbook (Mini Handbook)
**Version:** 0.1.0 | **Date:** 2026-01-27

## 1. Mission
Establish a resilient, security-forward command structure that sustains critical operations under normal and contested conditions, including EMP, cyber, and physical disruptions.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Clarity of Command:** Single commander, clear deputies, defined authorities.
- **Resilience by Design:** Redundant power, comms, and logistics.
- **Tempo & Discipline:** Brief cycles, decision windows, explicit triggers.
- **Simplicity:** Short, unambiguous checklists and SOPs.
- **Decentralization:** Local autonomy within commander’s intent.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Commander (CDR):** Intent, priorities, authorizations.
- **XO:** Synchronization, time management, escalation.
- **S3 (Ops):** Plans, battle rhythm, tasking, reporting.
- **S2 (Intel/Sec):** Threats, risks, countermeasures.
- **S4 (Log):** Fuel, water, spares, transport.
- **S6 (Comms/IT):** Networks, radios, EMP shielding, backups.

## 4. Command & Control
- **Battle Rhythm:** 08/12/18 SitReps; 10/16 Command Huddles (15 min).
- **Brief Formats:** 5-paragraph: Situation, Mission, Execution, Sustainment, Signals.
- **Decision Triggers:** Pre-defined conditions that authorize pre-planned actions.
- **Authority Matrix:** Who can authorize what under which conditions.

## 5. Communications
- **Primary:** Wired + local mesh nodes.
- **Alternate:** UHF/VHF, HF as last resort.
- **Contingency:** Runners, signal flags.
- **Emergency:** One-time pads + brevity codes.
- **COMSEC:** Key rotation, air-gapped key store, compromised-key drill.

## 6. Security & EMP
- **EMP Shielding:** Faraday storage for radios, spares, critical sensors.
- **Grounding & Surge:** Bonding plan; ferrites; MOVs on feeds.
- **Access Control:** Badges + PIN + 2-person rule for TS areas.
- **Incident:** See EMP Playbook; immediate posture shift to **ALPHA-LOCK**.

## 7. Power & Microgrids
- **Primary:** Grid + generator.
- **Backup:** Resonance Energy Systems micro-hydro/ram pump turbine (local).
- **Priority Loads:** Comms, pumps, refrigeration, medical.
- **Blackstart:** Start sequence per EMP Playbook (0–1h / 1–24h).

## 8. Logistics & Sustainment
- **Fuel:** 10-day diesel target; FIFO; water separators.
- **Spares:** A/B hot spares for radios, routers, pumps, sensors.
- **Medical:** Trauma kits + ICS charts; rest cycles; heat/cold risk management.

## 9. Drills & Training
- Weekly comms check; monthly EMP drill; quarterly full blackout rehearsal.
- After-Action Reviews (AARs) within 48 hours; assign owners; track to closure.

## 10. Glossary
- **ALPHA-LOCK:** Max security posture; restricted movement.
- **Blackstart:** Cold start of system without external power.
- **CDR’s Intent:** North star for decentralized action.
