# LUDWIG LAW CORP LLC — OPERATING DOCTRINE (V1.0)

**Purpose:** Convert elite-firm insights into a durable, execution-ready LLC corporate structure and operating system for a 2100-proof, AI-driven legal enterprise.

**Design Choices Informed By Top-25 Leaders:**
- Integrated (LLC/LLP) over Swiss verein for tighter financial alignment, one-firm delivery, and pricing/PEP discipline (Kirkland/Latham/Skadden model).
- Selective global nodes (Kirkland/Skadden) over "everywhere" sprawl at the core; add satellite affiliates for coverage where needed.
- Private-capital + disputes + regulatory triangle as the economic engine and cycle hedge (Kirkland/Latham/Quinn/Davis Polk pattern).
- AI+process rigor to drive RPL uplift (Latham style), mandatory citation/verification (Ludwig standard), and change-to-control automation.

## 1) Entity Stack & Legal Form

### 1.1 TopCo
- **Name:** Ludwig Law Corp LLC ("Ludwig LLC").
- **Jurisdiction:** Delaware (Series LLC optional), chosen for tested corporate law, chancery court maturity, and flexible OA terms.
- **Form Rationale:** Single integrated profit pool to enforce "one-firm" incentives. Manager-managed governance for professional CEO/GC control while keeping member protections. Option to elect C-Corp tax later if capital markets or equity instruments require it.

### 1.2 Sub-Holds & Operating Subs
- US Ops LLP (practice entity), UK LLP, EU GmbH/SARL nodes, SG Pte Ltd hub for APAC, UAE ADGM entity.
- Special Purpose Subs: IPCo (all models, code, trademarks, patents), DataCo (regulated data, residency), TechOpsCo (AI/infra), AdvisoryCo (non-legal consulting).
- Affiliations (as needed): Local alliances under affiliation agreements (not a verein) with strict brand/licensing and conflicts parity.

### 1.3 Engagement & Risk Shells
- Professional entities in practice jurisdictions for licensing and malpractice ring-fencing.
- Centralized insurance program (malpractice, cyber, D&O) with claims-made triggers, tail coverage, and panel counsel.

## 2) Governance & Alignment (Manager-Managed)

### 2.1 Core Roles
- Board of Managers (5-7): strategy, risk, capital allocation.
- Chief Legal Architect (CLA): doctrine, verification standards, neuro-symbolic architecture.
- General Counsel (GC): ethics, privilege, regulator interface.
- Chief Compliance & Assurance (CCA): controls-as-code, audits, model lifecycle assurance.
- Head of Neuro-Symbolic Systems (HNSS): LLM+rules engine integration, evals, rollback.
- Regional Managing Partners (RMPs): U.S., UK/EU, APAC, MEA—P&L owners within one-firm KPIs.

### 2.2 Committees
- Conflicts & Independence Committee (CIC)
- Pricing, Profitability & Portfolio Committee (P3C)
- Model Risk & Safety Committee (MRSC)
- Audit & Evidence Locker Committee (AELC)
- Lateral & Talent Economics Committee (LTEC)

### 2.3 Compensation Doctrine
- Integrated pool with firmwide scorecards (RPL, win rate, matter GM, realization, verified-accuracy).
- Team-based crediting (origination + execution + cross-region).
- Strategic premium: uplifts for sectors/core products (e.g., private capital, antitrust, cross-border disputes), and AI leverage metrics (matter hours saved vs. accuracy).

## 3) Operating Divisions (Products, Not Just Practices)
- Office of the General Counsel (Ethics/Privilege/Regulatory)
  - Division A: Corporate, M&A & Private Capital (DealFlow AI)
  - Division B: Litigation, Arbitration & Investigations (LitigatorSim)
  - Division C: Global Compliance & Regulatory (Regulus Compliance Grid)
  - Division D: IP, Patents & Tech (IP Sentinel)
  - Division E: Contracts & Commercial (ContractForge)
  - Division F: Sovereign, Treaty & Geopolitical (SovereignOps)

**Productization:** Every division ships AI-backed products (playbooks, clause kits, controls, dashboards) with SLAs and quality gates.

## 4) AI-First Legal OS (2100-Proof)

### 4.1 Intelligence Fabric
- Retrieval: Hybrid dense/sparse + citation graph; jurisdiction tagging; effective-date versioning.
- Reasoning: LLM + Symbolic (LegalRuleML) for obligations/exceptions; Toolformer agents (retrieve statute, diff amendments, compute deadlines).
- Verification: Mandatory citation packs (snippet, version ID, jurisdiction); contradiction agents; uncertainty thresholds → escalation.
- Simulation: Venue-specific litigation forecasts; regulatory scenario trees (3-20 yrs).

### 4.2 Controls-as-Code
- Every obligation maps to Control → Owner → Evidence → Test.
- Delta learning: New law auto-generates tests and redlines controls; board alert within defined SLA.

### 4.3 Safety & Audit
- Evidence Locker: immutable source snapshots, model hashes, prompts/version logs.
- Model Lifecycle: eval suites per jurisdiction, drift canaries, one-click rollback.
- Privilege Zones: segregated embeddings, opt-out from cross-case training, encryption-at-field.

## 5) Conflicts, Independence & Client Selection

### 5.1 Conflicts Standard (One-Firm)
- Single global conflicts system; treat affiliates as part of the same conflicts perimeter (avoid verein pitfalls).
- Economic incentives: cross-office referrals count toward comp; no P&L disincentives to share.
- Red/Amber/Green matrix for corporate families, opposing party histories, sovereign overlaps.

### 5.2 Example Policy Clause
**Conflicts Perimeter.** For conflicts, independence, confidentiality, and privilege, all Ludwig entities and affiliates shall be treated as a single firm. No engagement may proceed without CIC clearance where: (i) an affiliate represents a directly adverse party; (ii) matter facts materially overlap; or (iii) sovereign client sensitivities require elevated screening.

## 6) Pricing, Profitability & Matter Economics

### 6.1 Pricing Doctrine
- Portfolio pricing for sponsors and repeat litigants; success fees/AFAs for high-confidence disputes.
- Rate integrity: publish a Global Rate Card with regional modifiers and AI-assisted scoping that binds estimates to matter plans.

### 6.2 Matter GM & RPL Levers
- AI leverage quota per matter (minimum % of tasks automated with verification).
- Realization guardrails with early alerts; write-down review at P3C.

### 6.3 Clause (Operating Agreement — Pricing)
**Section 7.3 Pricing Integrity.** The P3C shall approve and periodically adjust firmwide pricing bands. Any engagement below approved bands requires pre-approval and a documented path to portfolio value (cross-sell, data rights, strategic positioning) within 12 months.

## 7) Compliance, Assurance & Regulator Readiness

### 7.1 Controls-as-Code Library
- Store obligations as YAML (jurisdiction, bindingness, effective date), link to Controls, Evidence, Test Cases.
- Quarterly assurance: sample testing + remediation owners; board-level risk heatmap.

### 7.2 Auditability
- All advice must be reconstructible: sources, versions, prompts, model outputs.
- Regulatory kit: instant export for supervisory exams (privacy, AML, sanctions, AI safety).

### 7.3 Example Obligation Block
```yaml
obligation:
  id: us-sec-13a-reports
  jurisdiction: US
  source: Exchange Act 13(a)
  binding: "regulation+rule"
controls:
  - id: periodic-filings-calendar
    owner: GC-Reporting
    frequency: continuous
evidence:
  - system_export: "edgar_filing_log.csv"
tests:
  - name: "Timeliness check"
    query: "all due filings submitted by deadline"
    expected: 100%
```

## 8) Talent Economics & Lateral Strategy

### 8.1 Scorecards (Team-First)
- Inputs: Origination, delivery, cross-sell, accuracy with citations, client NPS, AI leverage (hours saved), training contributions.
- Outputs: RPL uplift, matter GM, realization, win rates.

### 8.2 Lateral Diligence
- Playbook: book durability, conflict profile, sector adjacency, AI adoption mindset.
- Comp bands: targeted premiums for private capital, complex disputes, and regulatory leaders.

## 9) Risk, Security & Continuity to 2100
- Zero-trust identity; confidential compute for sensitive matters.
- Cold-path legal kernel for offline operation (last-known corpus).
- Multi-model orchestration to avoid vendor lock-in; hot-swap interfaces.
- Geo-residency: pin data per jurisdiction; data treaties register.

## 10) KPIs & Evals (Reported Quarterly to the Board)
- Grounded Accuracy: % advice with verified citations above threshold.
- Material Omission Rate: exceptions/safe harbors missed per 1,000 answers.
- Change Latency: law change → control updated → evidence verified (hours).
- RPL & Matter GM: per division, trimmed for write-offs.
- Litigation Brier Score: outcome calibration by venue.
- Client NPS by product line.
- Red Team Findings: time-to-fix and recurrence rate.
