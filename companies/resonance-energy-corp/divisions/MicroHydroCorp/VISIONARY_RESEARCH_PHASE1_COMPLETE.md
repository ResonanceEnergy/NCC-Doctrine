## Key Quotations Driving Design Philosophy

> "Water is not a dead mass; it is a living organism." — Viktor Schauberger  
> *Implication: Design should work WITH water's nature, not against it.*

> "If you wish to understand the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration." — Nikola Tesla  
> *Implication: Optimize for energy efficiency across all frequency ranges.*

> "The best microhydro system is one that the community can build, operate, and maintain themselves." — Jack Winter  
> *Implication: Simplicity, local components, user empowerment.*
