- Placement: Center of housing, surrounded by magnetic array on all sides
- Stability: Permanent (no replacement needed, unlike filters or consumables)

**Flow Geometry** (Schauberger Integration):

- Outlet: Axial center (vortex exhaust, water exits with rotational momentum)
- Inner diameter: 80mm (flow channel, allows 100-1,000 L/min depending on pressure)
- Baffles: φ-scaled spiral ribs (optional, guide flow into optimal vortex pattern)

**Basalt Lining** (Callahan Paramagnetism Synergy):

## PART III: FABRICATION PROCESS

### Phase 1: Housing Fabrication

**Option A: CNC Machined Housing** (Prototype, small batch)
- Start with 316SS solid bar stock (120mm dia × 550mm length)
- CNC lathe: Bore interior to 80mm (flow channel), turn exterior to 100mm
- CNC mill: Machine inlet (tangential, 45° angle), outlet (axial center), flange faces
- Surface finish: 32 Ra interior (before basalt coating), 16 Ra exterior (polished)
- Time: 4-8 hours CNC programming + machining
- Cost: $300-800 per housing (material + machine time)

**Option B: Welded Pipe Housing** (Medium/high volume)
- Start with 316SS seamless pipe (DN100 Schedule 10, 500mm length)
- Weld end caps (316SS discs, TIG welded, pressure-tested)
- Machine inlet/outlet ports (drill + tap or weld fittings)
- Machine flange faces (lathe, ensure flatness for gasket seal)
- Surface finish: 32 Ra interior (welded pipe is typically 63-125 Ra, need light honing)
- Time: 2-4 hours (welding + machining)
- Cost: $150-400 per housing (pipe + caps + fittings + labor)

**Recommended**: **Option B** for production (2-4× cheaper, scalable)

**Basalt Lining Application**:
1. Mix basalt powder (200-400 mesh, 500g) + marine epoxy resin (2-part, 200-300ml) = slurry
2. Spray or brush coat interior (1-3mm thickness, ensure uniform coverage)
3. Cure 24-48 hours (room temperature, or 50-70°C oven for faster cure)
4. Light sanding (smooth any drips or rough spots, maintain 32 Ra or better)

---

### Phase 2: Magnetic Array Assembly

**Dodecahedron Geometry** (12-vertex sacred geometry):
- Vertices: 12 positions in 3D space (Platonic solid, φ-proportioned)
- Coordinates: Calculate using φ-ratio (1.618:1) and golden angle (137.5°)
- Polarity pattern: Alternating N-S (or more complex pattern like N-N-S-S for vortex field)

**Magnet Mounting Cage**:
- Material: 316SS sheet (1-2mm thickness) or 3D-printed (nylon, PETG for prototyping)
- Design: Dodecahedron cage with pockets for magnets (press-fit or epoxy-bonded)
- Dimensions: 70mm inscribed diameter (fits inside 80mm flow channel, leaves 5mm clearance)
- Fastening: Center rod (316SS, 8mm dia) + end caps (secure cage axially)

**Assembly Steps**:
1. 3D print or sheet-metal fabricate dodecahedron cage (CAD model, export STL or DXF)
2. Insert neodymium magnets (N52, 25mm dia × 10mm) into pockets
3. Secure magnets (epoxy bond or mechanical snap-fit, ensure no movement)
4. Verify polarity pattern (gauss meter, check field lines follow vortex pattern)
5. Mount information water vial at center (glass vial, 500ml, sealed)
6. Insert assembled cage into housing (slide through end, secure with end cap)

**Magnetic Field Testing**:
- Gauss meter: Measure field strength at water interface (target: 1,000-3,000 Gauss)
- Field mapping: Measure at 10-20 points (inlet, outlet, circumference) = verify vortex pattern
- Polarity check: Compass or iron filings (visualize field lines, should show spiral/vortex)

---

### Phase 3: Final Assembly & Testing

**Assembly Steps**:
1. Insert magnetic array cage + information water vial into housing
2. Install inlet/outlet fittings (flange or threaded connections)
3. Install spiral baffles (optional, φ-scaled ribs to guide flow)
4. Seal end caps (gaskets, bolts, torque to spec 40-60 ft-lbs)
5. Pressure test (10 bar water pressure, 10 minutes, check for leaks)
6. Flow test (100-1,000 L/min, measure pressure drop <0.5 psi)

**Water Quality Testing** (Before/After):
- **Surface tension**: Measure with tensiometer (structured water = lower surface tension, 60-65 mN/m vs. 72 mN/m tap)
- **pH**: Measure with pH meter (may shift slightly, typically 6.5-8.0 range)
- **Conductivity**: Measure with TDS meter (should not change significantly, validates no contamination)
- **Dissolved oxygen**: Measure with DO meter (structured water may show increased DO)
- **Plant growth test**: Control group (tap water) vs. RWR water, 12-week trial (measure germination, growth rate, yield)

**Magnetic Imprinting Protocol** (Information Water Core):
1. Fill 500ml borosilicate glass vial with mountain spring water (<50 ppm TDS)
2. Expose to dodecahedron magnetic array for 30 days (vial at center of array, continuous exposure)
3. Seal vial (airtight, permanent seal, never opened)
4. Install in RWR Module housing (becomes permanent "template" for flowing water)

**Quality Control Checklist**:
- [ ] Housing leak test (10 bar, 10 minutes, zero leaks)
- [ ] Magnetic field strength (1,000-3,000 Gauss at water interface)
- [ ] Pressure drop (<0.5 psi at rated flow)

### ROI Analysis: RWR Module vs. Grander Licensing

**Scenario A: License Grander** (10-year cost)
- Upfront licensing fee: $10k-50k (estimated, assuming exclusive territory)
- Grander module wholesale: $1,500-3,000 per unit (buy from Grander)
- Royalty on system sales: 2-5% of system price ($2k-7.5k per system)
- **Total cost (500 systems over 10 years)**:
  - Upfront: $10k-50k
  - Modules: 500 × $2,250 average = $1,125k
  - Royalties: 500 × $4,750 average = $2,375k
  - **TOTAL: $3.51M-3.55M**

**Scenario B: Build RWR Module** (10-year cost)
- Development investment: $35k-65k (one-time, Year 1)
- Production cost: $330-770 per unit (at scale, 1,000+ units)
- Zero royalties (100% margin on water structuring component)
- **Total cost (500 systems over 10 years)**:
  - Development: $35k-65k
  - Production: 500 × $550 average = $275k
  - **TOTAL: $310k-340k**

**Savings**: **$3.17M-3.24M over 10 years** (91-92% cost reduction)

**Additional Benefits**:
- IP ownership: RWR Module patentable, licensable (potential $500k-5M+ value)
- Margin control: Can adjust pricing, upgrade designs, no external constraints
- Competitive moat: Exclusive technology, no competitor can replicate (without licensing from us)
