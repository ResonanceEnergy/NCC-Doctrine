### Engineering Principles

#### Design Fundamentals
1. **Force Harnessing:** Convert wind kinetic energy into rotational mechanical energy
2. **Aerodynamic Optimization:**
   - Sail angle adjusts to wind speed (cloth can be furled or extended)
   - Rotation axis perpendicular to wind direction maximizes power capture
   - Optimal rotor speed balance: fast enough to generate power, slow enough to be controlled
3. **Yaw & Orientation:**
   - Fantail mechanisms (small secondary rotor) auto-orient mill to face wind
   - Manual tail vane for earlier designs required periodic adjustment
4. **Speed & Torque Control:**
   - Governor systems (mechanical feedback) regulate rotational speed as wind varies
   - Gearing allows high-torque, low-RPM wind rotor to drive faster mill equipment

#### Key Components (Post Mill Example)
- **Blades/sails:** Canvas stretched on wooden frames; angle adjustable for wind conditions
- **Rotor hub:** Where sails attach; transfers torque to main shaft
- **Main shaft:** Transmits rotational power through gearing
- **Gear train:** Reduces RPM from rotor (~20 RPM) to mill drive (~100–200 RPM)
- **Gearbox/millstones:** Final drive mechanism, adjusted for specific task (grain grinding, sawing, etc.)
- **Bearing system:** Wooden journal bearings, later iron; required frequent greasing
- **Brake system:** Large friction brake to stop rotor; crucial for operator safety
- **Tail vane/fantail:** Keeps mill oriented into wind

#### Durability & Maintenance
- **Material degradation:** Canvas sails lasted 2–3 years; wood components required regular replacement
- **Bearing wear:** Lubrication critical (animal fat, later oils); bearings worn out every 10–20 years
- **Weather exposure:** Constant wind and rain weathered materials; protective coatings and paint essential
- **Seasonal variability:** Wind availability highly seasonal; mills might be idle during calm periods
- **Failure modes:** Structural overload in high winds, bearing seizure, blade imbalance
