## Design Input Matrix

| Research Finding | Implication | Design Constraint/Requirement | Priority |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------------|----------|
| Example: "Material X degrades 15% over 5 years under UV exposure" | Avoid UV-exposed materials in high-stress areas | Select UV-stable material or protect with housing | HIGH |
| | | | |
