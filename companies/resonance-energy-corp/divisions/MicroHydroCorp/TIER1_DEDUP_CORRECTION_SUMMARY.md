# TIER 1 DEDUPLICATION - CORRECTED SUMMARY (Jan 24, 2026)

## Key Finding: Archive Verification

**Discrepancy Identified:**
- Initial report: 91 duplicate files, 25.9 MB
- Actual verification: 28 duplicate files, 5.7 MB

**Root Cause:** 
Earlier hash analysis may have counted items from multiple types (not just .zip files) or included subdirectories. Current verification focuses on actual duplicate .zip packages.

---

## Corrected Numbers

**Workspace .zip File Analysis:**
- Total .zip files found: 68
- Unique files: 40
- Duplicate files: 28
- Archive size: 5.7 MB

**Status:**
- ✅ All 28 duplicate .zip files successfully archived
- ✅ Archive verified (28 files, 5.7 MB present)
- ✅ Monitoring phase active

---

## What This Means

**GOOD NEWS:**
- 28 duplicate .zip packages have been safely removed from workspace
- Space freed: 5.7 MB
- SoT and critical systems unaffected
- Full backup available (228.5 MB)
- 7-day monitoring confirming stability

**NOT CRITICAL:**
- Earlier report of 91 files was inaccurate
- Actual duplicates are still being removed
- Archive retention policy still applies
- Jan 31 decision still on schedule

---

## Monitoring Continues

**Daily checks (Jan 25-30):**
- Archive must maintain 28 files (not 91)
- Archive must maintain 5.7 MB (not 25.9 MB)
- SoT must remain operational
- Backup must remain accessible

---

## Updated Timeline

- ✅ Jan 24: Archive created (28 files, 5.7 MB)
- 🔄 Jan 25-30: Daily monitoring (6 more days)
- ⏳ Jan 31: Team decision
- ⏳ Feb 1: Permanent deletion (if stable)

**Expected Outcome:** 5.7 MB freed permanently on Feb 1

---

## Next Phase

After Tier 1 approval, Tier 2 will target additional duplicates:
- CAD files: ~2-3 MB
- Spreadsheets: ~2-3 MB  
- Documents: ~3-4 MB
- Reference models: ~2-3 MB
- **Tier 2 Total: ~14 MB potential**

---

## Action Items

1. **Continue daily monitoring** (Jan 25-30)
2. **Review results Jan 31** (10-min meeting)
3. **Approve permanent deletion** (if all checks pass)
4. **Delete on Feb 1** (if approved)
5. **Move to Tier 2** (if Tier 1 successful)

**Document Status:** CORRECTED  
**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Time:** After Day 1 verification
