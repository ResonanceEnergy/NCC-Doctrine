- **Nikola Tesla** (1856–1943) — Electrical systems; polyphase AC, distributed energy
- **Jack Winter** (1950–present) — Microhydro pioneer; practical engineering, community-centered design

✅ **30 Insights Extracted & Synthesized:**
- 10 insights per visionary with traceability to patents, published works, archives
- Aggregated into 4 cross-cutting themes (Design, Efficiency, Durability, Systems)
- Mapped to 18 high-priority design constraints
- Formulated 6 R&D hypotheses for Phase 2 testing
