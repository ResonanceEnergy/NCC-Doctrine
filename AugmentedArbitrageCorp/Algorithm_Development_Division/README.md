# Algorithm Development Division

## Overview
The Algorithm Development Division builds and optimizes arbitrage detection and execution algorithms for Augmented Arbitrage Corp. We focus on creating high-performance, low-latency systems that identify and capitalize on market inefficiencies across global exchanges.

## Mission
To develop cutting-edge algorithmic trading systems that capture arbitrage opportunities with precision, speed, and reliability.

## Key Products
- **Statistical Arbitrage Models**: Cross-market correlation analysis and mean-reversion strategies
- **High-Frequency Trading Bots**: Sub-millisecond execution algorithms for flash arbitrage
- **Machine Learning Arbitrage Systems**: AI-driven pattern recognition for complex arbitrage opportunities

## Team Structure
- **Director of Algorithm Development**: Overall strategy and architecture
- **Lead Quantitative Researcher**: Statistical modeling and backtesting
- **Senior Algorithm Engineer**: System implementation and optimization
- **Data Scientist**: Machine learning model development
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure automation and deployment

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python, C++, Rust
